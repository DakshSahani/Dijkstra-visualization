    <h1>Dijktra's Algorithm</h1>
    <section class="theory">
      <h3>Theory</h3>
      <p>
        Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that is used to find
        the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It was
        developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and is
        widely used in various applications, such as routing protocols in
        computer networks and pathfinding in maps and navigation systems.
    </p>
      <p>
          The algorithm works on a graph that consists of nodes (also called vertices)
          and edges. Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it, which
          represents the distance or cost of traversing from one node to another.
          Dijkstra's algorithm aims to find the shortest path from a starting node
          to all other nodes in the graph. It guarantees finding the shortest 
          path when all edge weights are non-negative.

      <p>Follow the steps below to solve the problem: <br /><br /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of
          vertices included in the shortest-path tree, i.e., whose minimum
          distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this
          set is empty.
        </li>

        <li>
          Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize
          all distance values as INFINITE. Assign the distance value as 0 for
          the source vertex so that it is picked first. <br />
          While sptSet doesn't include all vertices
        </li>

        <li>
          Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has a minimum
          distance value.
        </li>

        <li>Include u to sptSet.</li>

        <li>
          Then update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. <br />
          To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices.
          <br />
          For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of the distance value of u
          (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value
          of v, then update the distance value of v.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note: We use a boolean array sptSet[] to represent the set of vertices
          included in SPT. If a value sptSet[v] is true, then vertex v is
          included in SPT, otherwise not. Array dist[] is used to store the
          shortest distance values of all vertices.
        </li>
      </ul>
